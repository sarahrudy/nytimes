# The New York Times 
'The New York Times' is an application that makes a fetch call to the New York Times API for article data. A user is able to click on the article card to take them to the New Times Website to view the full article. A user is also able to click on a category to limit articles to those that match their interest. 

The app features a responsive design which can be viewed on mobile devices with end-to-end cypress testing.
